## 📚 Complete Tutorial

### Understanding Crawl Depth

**Depth** controls how far the scraper explores from your seed URLs:

- **Depth 1**: Only scrapes the exact URLs you provide
  - Use when: You have a specific list of pages
  - Result: Fast, precise, ~10-50 pages

- **Depth 2**: Scrapes seeds + all links found on those pages ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
  - Use when: You want to explore a section thoroughly
  - Result: Medium speed, ~50-500 pages

- **Depth 3+**: Goes deeper into the site hierarchy
  - Use when: You want comprehensive coverage
  - Result: Slower, can find 500-10,000+ pages

**Pro Tip**: Start with depth 2. You can always run it again deeper if you need more data.

### Setting Up Quality Filters

Quality filters are your best friend. Here's how to use them effectively:

#### Example 1: High-Quality Technical Blog

```
Content Type: Article/Blog
Keywords Must Contain: tutorial, guide, how-to, explained
Keywords Exclude: subscribe, buy now, ad, promotion
Quality Threshold: 70
Min Chars: 500
Same Domain Only: ✓ Enabled
```

**Result**: Only keeps well-written, informative articles.

#### Example 2: Documentation Scraping

```
Content Type: Documentation  
Keywords Must Contain: API, function, parameter, example
Keywords Exclude: pricing, contact, enterprise
Quality Threshold: 75
Min Chars: 300
Ignore Quality for Short Content: ✗ Disabled
```

**Result**: Technical documentation with code examples.

#### Example 3: Recipe Collection

```
Content Type: Recipe
Keywords Must Contain: ingredients, instructions, servings
Keywords Exclude: sponsored, affiliate, advertisement
Quality Threshold: 60
Allow Short High-Quality Content: ✓ Enabled
Short Min: 150
```

**Result**: Complete recipes, including shorter ones if high-quality.

### Content Type Selection Guide

Not sure which content type to use? Here's a decision tree:

```
📄 Scraping what?
├─ 🍔 Food/cooking website? → Recipe
├─ 📖 How-to guides/tutorials? → Tutorial/How-To
├─ 📝 News/opinion articles? → Article/Blog
├─ 🛠️ Technical documentation? → Documentation
├─ ❓ FAQ/support pages? → FAQ
├─ 🛒 Product descriptions? → Product Info
├─ 💻 GitHub/source code? → Code File
└─ 🤷 Not sure? → Generic/Auto-detect
```

### Advanced: Using the Subdomain Crawler

Enable **Automatic Subdomain Discovery** to explore related subdomains:

**Example**: Starting from `example.com`, it will discover and crawl:
- www.example.com
- blog.example.com
- docs.example.com
- api.example.com
- shop.example.com

**When to use**:
- ✅ Large sites with multiple subdomains
- ✅ Documentation split across docs.*, help.*, support.*
- ❌ When you want focused, specific content

## 🤝 Working with NTTuner

The entire point of NTCompanion is to create data for [NTTuner](https://github.com/noosed/NTTuner). Here's the complete workflow:

### Step 1: Create Your Dataset with NTCompanion

```bash
# 1. Scrape your data
python NTCompanion.py
# Configure and scrape as shown above
# Output: scraped_data.jsonl
```

### Step 2: Verify Your Dataset

Quick check:
```bash
# On Windows
type scraped_data.jsonl | find /c "{"

# On Linux/Mac  
wc -l scraped_data.jsonl
```

This tells you how many training examples you have.

**How much data do you need?**
- **Minimum**: 100 examples (very small, targeted task)
- **Good**: 500-1,000 examples (solid fine-tune)
- **Great**: 2,000-5,000 examples (comprehensive dataset)
- **Overkill**: 10,000+ examples (diminishing returns)

### Step 3: Configure NTTuner

1. **Open NTTuner**:
   ```bash
   python NTTuner.py
   ```

2. **Load Your Dataset**:
   - Click "Browse" next to Dataset Path
   - Select your `scraped_data.jsonl` file

3. **Choose a Base Model**:
   - For 8GB GPU: `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`
   - For 12GB GPU: `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`  
   - For 16GB+ GPU: `mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407`

4. **Set Training Parameters**:
   - **LoRA Rank**: 16-32 (start with 16)
   - **Epochs**: 1-3 (start with 1)
   - **Batch Size**: 4 (reduce if OOM)
   - **Learning Rate**: 2e-4 (default is good)

5. **Configure Output**:
   - **Model Name**: Give it a meaningful name
   - **Quantization**: q5\_k\_m (good balance)
   - **Import to Ollama**: ✓ Enabled

6. **Click "Start Training"**

### Step 4: Use Your Fine-Tuned Model

Once training completes:

```bash
# Test your model
ollama run your-model-name

# Example conversation
>>> Hello! I need help with a recipe.
>>> Can you explain how to make chocolate chip cookies?
```

Your model should now respond with knowledge from your scraped dataset!

### Template Matching

**IMPORTANT**: The chat template in NTCompanion must match your NTTuner base model:

| NTTuner Base Model | NTCompanion Template |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| meta-llama/Llama-3.2-* | Meta Llama-3.1/3.2/3.3 Instruct |
| mistralai/Mistral-* | Mistral Nemo/Large Instruct |
| Qwen/Qwen2.5-* | Qwen2.5 Instruct |
| microsoft/Phi-4 | Phi-4 Instruct |
| google/gemma-2-* | Gemma-2 Instruct |

**If they don't match**, NTTuner won't be able to parse your dataset correctly!

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Saving & Loading Configs

**Save your configuration**:
1. Set up all your parameters
2. Click "Save Config"
3. Choose a location (e.g., `recipe_scraper.json`)

**Load a saved configuration**:
1. Click "Load Config"
2. Select your JSON file
3. All settings populate automatically

**Pro Tip**: Create multiple config files for different projects:
- `recipes.json`
- `tech_docs.json`
- `tutorials.json`

### System Prompts

System prompts define how the AI should behave. NTCompanion includes presets:

- **Blank**: No system prompt (rare use case)
- **Helpful Assistant**: General purpose ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Data Summarizer**: For summarization tasks
- **Code Expert**: For technical/code content
- **Creative Writer**: For narrative, story-like content
- **NTTuner Default**: Optimized for reasoning

**Custom System Prompts**:

```
You are a knowledgeable cooking assistant specialized in 
international cuisine. Provide detailed, step-by-step 
instructions and explain cooking techniques clearly.
```

Click dropdown → Select "Helpful Assistant" → Modify the text box → Done!

### Understanding User Prompts

Each content type has a **user prompt template** that creates the question part of the training data.

**Example for Recipes**:
```
Template: "How do I make {title}?"
Scraped Title: "Chocolate Chip Cookies"
Result: "How do I make Chocolate Chip Cookies?"
```

The AI learns to respond to questions like this with the scraped content.

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Start small** - Test with 2-3 URLs before scaling up
2. **Use quality filtering** - Don't disable it unless you have a reason
3. **Match content types** - Select the right preset for your data
4. **Enable "Same Domain Only"** - When building focused datasets
5. **Set keyword filters** - Be specific about what you want/don't want
6. **Save your configs** - Reuse successful configurations
7. **Monitor the console** - Watch for patterns in failures
8. **Iterate** - Adjust filters based on initial results

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't skip quality filtering** - You'll get lots of junk
2. **Don't use depth 5+** - You'll scrape forever (and maybe get blocked)
3. **Don't set workers too high** - Above 30 is asking for trouble
4. **Don't ignore robots.txt** - The scraper respects it automatically
5. **Don't scrape paywalled content** - It won't work and it's unethical
6. **Don't forget to match templates** - NTTuner won't understand mismatched data
7. **Don't collect more than you need** - 5,000 examples is plenty for most tasks

### Performance Tips

**For speed**:
```
Workers: 20-30
Depth: 2
Quality Threshold: 50
Crawl Strategy: BFS (Breadth-first)
```

**For quality**:
```
Workers: 5-10
Depth: 2-3
Quality Threshold: 70
Enable all keyword filters
```

**For discovery**:
```
Workers: 10
Depth: 3-4
Same Domain: Disabled
Subdomain Discovery: Enabled
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: "No content extracted" for most pages**

**Solution**:
- Lower quality threshold to 40
- Check if keywords are too restrictive
- Disable "Ignore Quality Filter for Short Content"
- Try "Generic/Auto-detect" content type

---

**Problem: Too much junk data collected**

**Solution**:
- Increase quality threshold to 65-70
- Add exclusion keywords: `privacy, terms, about, subscribe, newsletter`
- Enable "Same Domain Only"
- Reduce crawl depth to 2

---

**Problem: Scraping is very slow**

**Solution**:
- Increase workers to 20-30
- Reduce crawl depth
- Check your internet connection
- Some sites have rate limiting (be patient)

---

**Problem: Getting blocked/403 errors**

**Solution**:
- Reduce workers to 5-10
- The scraper already rotates user agents and respects rate limits
- Some sites simply don't allow scraping
- Try adding delays between requests (edit `CRAWL_DELAY` in code)

---

**Problem: NTTuner can't load the dataset**

**Solution**:
- Check that chat template matches base model
- Verify JSONL file isn't corrupted:
  ```bash
  python -m json.tool scraped_data.jsonl
  ```
- Make sure each line is valid JSON
- Check file encoding is UTF-8

---

**Problem: Out of memory during large crawls**

**Solution**:
- Install mmh3: `pip install mmh3` (enables Bloom filter)
- Reduce workers to 10
- Set "Stop After N" limit
- Process in smaller batches

## 🔒 Legal & Ethical Usage

### ⚖️ Legal Considerations

**Before scraping a website**:
1. Check their `robots.txt` file (scraper respects this automatically)
2. Review their Terms of Service
3. Look for an official API (always prefer APIs when available)
4. Consider seeking permission for commercial use

**Copyright**:
- Scraped data may be copyrighted
- Fine-tuning on copyrighted data is a gray area legally
- Use for research/personal projects is generally safer
- Commercial use requires more caution

### 🤝 Be Respectful

**NTCompanion includes built-in protections**:
- ✅ Rate limiting per domain
- ✅ User agent rotation
- ✅ Respects robots.txt
- ✅ Exponential backoff on errors

**But you should still**:
- Keep workers reasonable (10-20 is plenty)
- Don't hammer small sites
- Respect paywalls
- Don't scrape personal/private data
- Consider the website's resources

### ✅ Good Use Cases

- ✅ Publicly accessible content
- ✅ Educational research
- ✅ Personal learning projects
- ✅ Non-commercial fine-tuning
- ✅ Your own content scattered across sites
- ✅ Open-source documentation

### ❌ Bad Use Cases

- ❌ Circumventing paywalls
- ❌ Collecting personal information
- ❌ Commercial scraping without permission
- ❌ Social media at scale
- ❌ Financial/trading data (use official APIs)
- ❌ Anything explicitly forbidden in ToS

**Bottom line**: If you're unsure, ask permission or use an official API.
